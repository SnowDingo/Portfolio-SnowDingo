## BinaryFish

![BinaryFish](/BinaryFish.png)

BinaryFish is a tech blog fully built with Astro.js and is hosted on Vercel. 
The blog is updated every week, with new posts and updates to the website.


### Tech Stacks
Astro.js x Vercel 


## Astro.js & Starlight
I have also worked on open-source contributions as well. The two projects I contributed are Astro.js Documentation and Starlight.
I worked on translating the document from English to Japanese, and also worked on fixing styling and bugs on Astro Starlight.

## 3D Maze Demo
This is a project I created with GodotEngine in 2021. It is a demo of a maze game, where you have to collect 10 coins to win.
